# parking-spot-detector-and-counter--computerVision-neuralNetwork

you can get the data and the model from the "data.txt" file. I would like to thank the computer vision engineer YouTube channel for its contribution and help in improving myself with this model and data. The original project and model belong to him. I just re-did the project he did to improve myself.
